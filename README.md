# Foundation Optimization App

This repository contains a Streamlit app for optimizing foundation dimensions and weights. The app allows users to input various parameters related to the foundation and then run calculations or optimize the foundation dimensions to minimize the total weight. The results are displayed along with a comparison plot of the original and optimized foundation shapes.

## Features

- Calculate foundation dimensions and weights based on user inputs.
- Optimize foundation dimensions to minimize total weight.
- Visualize the original and optimized foundation shapes with a comparison plot.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Plotly
- Matplotlib
